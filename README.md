# Picture Paint [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dguo/picture-paint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dguo/picture-paint)
A [dynamic Firefox
theme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Themes/Theme_concepts#Dynamic_themes)

The theme automatically updates every day, and you can click the toolbar button
to see the picture and click through to the National Geographic page. Available

## Installation
This extension requires Firefox 60 and above. Install it from the
[Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/picture-paint/) page.
It might take a few seconds to process the image and then apply the theme.

## Build Instructions
I use the Node version specified in `.nvmrc`. Run `$ yarn install && yarn run
build:release`. This should generate the final JavaScript files and place
them in `extension/js`.

To generate a ZIP file for uploading to [Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/),
run `$ yarn run release`.

If you have Python 3 and Docker, you can also run `$ ./dev` for a development
CLI.
